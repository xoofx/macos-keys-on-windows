# Basic macOS keys on Windows

This is an AutoHotkey V2 script designed to bring essential macOS key combinations to Windows, making it easier to switch seamlessly between the two operating systems.

Additionally, as `LWin + Left Arrow` and `LWin + Right Arrow` are remapped above, we are loosing the functionality to move/snap the current Active window, so the script remaps these commands to `LWin + PgUp` and `LWin + Right Up` respectively. This allows to still use the Window snapping with these new keys.
